# ReMIT

This is a demo version and will be updated later.

### Train and Test

Training and testing are separate and can be implemented in "main.py".

You can also use "test.py" for single testing.

To store the final embeddings, floder "emb/bitotc" needed to be created in the same directory as "code" or "data".

### Datasets

The datasets used are all publicly available online, and we provide bitotc as an example.

If there is any infringement, it will be deleted immediately.
